# Paddy Disease Classification

---

## Introduction 
The agriculture is the most important way to feed the population around the world by farming crops such as Rice
which is one of the staple foods worldwide and the most consumed. The plantations such as rice, cassava, etc.
have often affected by certain diseases. However, these problems have attracted most of the experts in machine
learning filed. Thus, the main goal of this kaggle project is to develop a machine or deep learning-based model to
classify the given paddy leaf images accurately. In this project, we have focused specifically on rice plant (Oryza
sativa) disease. The images of the diseased symptoms in leaves and stems have been captured from the rice field.
The different methods used, our experiments and the results obtained are presented. The best score was obtained
using Resnet34 with 100 epochs accompanied with some deep layers. In the following sections, we provided
additional details about our experiment

## Data description

The datasets used for the project was obtained from the kaggle platform.The data consist of 10,407 (75%) dataset
for training and 3,469 (25%) dataset for testing. The labeled paddy leaf images has across ten classes (nine diseases
and normal leaf
